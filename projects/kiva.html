            <h4>** Update **</h4>
            <p>The dataset shared on Kaggle is a subset of the available data to the public. There is more data on their <a href"https://www.kiva.org/build/data-snapshots">website</a></p>
            <p>I'll release a second analysis with the expanded dataset soon. Apologies for the intermediate analysis in the meantime.</p>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>In 2018, Kiva <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding">released some of it's data</a> to the website Kaggle. If you haven't heard about Kaggle, don't worry about it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiva_(organization)">Kiva</a> is a non-profit organization that gives out micro-loans to entrepreneurs in developing economies. These crowd funded loans help grow the economy in these regions and have a very high repayment rate (~96%).</p>
            <p>According to the dataset on Kaggle, Kiva has executed 671205 loans totaling to $527.56 million There are around 1.35 million borrowers; 79.58% of borrowers are women</p>

          <div class="col-xs-5">
            <p>Plotting's always super helpful because in this case, it's obvious to me that there are some outliers here! One project has over 800 lenders for $10,000. This project was for "creat[ing] more than 300 jobs for women and farmers in rural Haiti." It seems to be the work of the Yunus Social Business (YSB), however I can't find this partner in the "loan_themes_by_region.csv". Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunus_Social_Business_%E2%80%93_Global_Initiatives">Wikipedia page</a> does list them as serving Haiti</p>
            <p>This may just be a quirk of the dataset. Also noticed that "loan_themes_by_region.csv" only accounts for $315.34 million of the total $506 million in the dataset with "partner_id"s. [Hopefully this resolves in the updated data]</p>

          <h4>Frequency of tags used</h4>
          <div class="col-xs-5">
            It may be surprising to see that the most used tag is "#Parent". Although in hindsight it makes sense, . Having responsiblity outside of yourself, especially for your child can fire your motivation. Moreover, it's a shared experience between lenders and borrowers that can build sympathy. Probably a combination of these two reasons are why the "#Parent" tag correlates so strongly with the "funded_amount". To philosophize some more, all the other tags are indirectly related to this one so it is a commonality shared with all. All themes are directed towards making the future a better place for our children. The "#Parent" tag is just the literal manifestation of this desire

          <div class="col-xs-7">
            <div id="tags" style="height:50%; width:100%;"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <h4>Correlations of Tags</h4>
          <div class="col-xs-4">
            <p>It's interesting that "#Health and Sanitation", "#Technology", and "#Eco-friendly" correlate negatively with the funded amounts. Meaning projects without these tags tend to be funded more. I'm currently working in a Neuroscience lab so the existence of p values &#60; 0.01 is pretty shocking.</p>
            <p>Again notice how well the "#Parent" tag correlates with the "funded_amount". It's hard to tell whether this is due to lenders being more sypathetic to parents or whether parents are more motivated entrepreneurs than non-parents</p>
