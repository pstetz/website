        <h2>Quantum Topology</h2>
        <p class="subtitle-text">Written: February 2021 (<a href="https://github.com/pstetz/quantum_topology">Github</a>)</p>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>The words "quantum" and "topology" both equally enchanting and pretentious can be fused together and amplify both attributes.  While I have not the slightest idea of Loop Quantum Gravity or anything besides basic topology, the following are fun projects are did in my spare time</p>
        <p>Thinking of space on the very smallest scales is really fun.  While a very long time ago people predicted matter might have a smallest form, it was only recently that people discovered energy can only be transferred in packets.  Extending these tiny packets to other "quata" has been one of the biggest successes in physics!  (By success, physicists are referring to almost purely reproducible predictions by the way.  Some aspects are very stange and unintuitive.  However other philospopers will argue it's connections to symmetry is beautiful.)</p>
        <p>Quantum Mechanics says something very fundamental about energy and information.  General Relativity says very fundamental things about spacetime.  They seem to butt heads in special occasions near the event horizon of a black hole.  People have tried to combine these two in String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity.  (It's weird we always assumed the simplist form of matter is a 0-D particle when the next simplest option is a 1-D string.)</p>
        <p>Anyways enough with this grand talk, I'm merely wanted to give background to why I spent time on the following...</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <h2>1.) Lattice</h2>
        <p>Let's imagine a lattice like in figure 1.</p>

        <p>Currently we're thinking in two dimensions, but that's just because it's easy to draw out.  We want to extend this to N dimensions, then set N=3 to represent our real world.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <h2>2.) Fermat's Last Theorem</h2>
        <p>Another way of thinking about Fermat's Last Theorem is that you can use two N-cubes like Legos to form another N-cube.</p>
        <p>This can be done by keeping one of the cubes intact and rearranging the bits of the other to form the final cube.  Figure 2 probably expresses this better than any words.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <h2>3.) The Possibility of Alien communication</h2>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <div class="col-xs-8">
          <p>Note: if the following comes off as intuitive and Newtonian to you, then you are very rightly suspicious that it is wrong!  The ideas here conflict with the description of the universe given by General Relativity.  In the words of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310808">T. Davis and C. Lineweaver</a>: "We can observe galaxies that have, and always have had, recession velocities greater than the speed of light".  This kind of thinking can lead you astray!</p>
          <p>We all learned at our mother's knee that the universe is expanding <u>and</u> that this expansion is accelatering.</p>
          <p>Astronomers describe this mathematically in the form of Hubble's law \( v = H_0 D \) </p>
        </div>

        </div>
        \[ \sum^{n}_{i=1} t_i = \frac{1}{H_0} ln(n + 1) \]
        \[ t_i - t_j = \frac{i (j + 1)}{j (i + 1)} \]
        \[ d_n = \frac{d_0}{n + 1} \]
        \[ t_n = \frac{1}{H_0} ln(\frac{d_0}{d_0 - d_n}) = \frac{1}{H_0} ln(\frac{n + 1}{n}) \]
        \[ d(t) = d + \int^t_0 H_0 d(t') \, dt' \]
        \[ p(t) = d - \int^t_0 c - H_0 p(t') \, dt' \]

        <p id="footnote_1">
        One of my favorite examples of this is the "prediction" of black holes by Newtonian gravity.  The escape velocity given by Newton is \( v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{r}} \).  Natively, you can set \( v_e = c \), which leads to the Schwarzschild radius \( r_s = \frac{2 G M}{c^2}  \).  While giving the right answer, this logic is wrong and overly simplified.  The argument is just as sound as \( \frac{64}{16} = \frac{\cancel{6}4}{1 \cancel{6}} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \).  For instance [paraphrased from S. Carroll.  Spacetime and Geometry], the escape velocity equation only mentions the <u>initial</u> velocity, but blacks holes are inescapeable from arbitrary timelike curves.
