### Doesn't need a readme, but I want a place where I can put down future improvements.

## To do list:

- add a reset button to the planets page

- make a window border for the planets page so the user can expand or contract the universe

- have a toggle button that will switch between an infinite universe, a finite universe (where objects bounce back), and a circuluar universe.
