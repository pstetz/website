          <li>26 Jan 2018 - I learned a lot of web development in the past couple months.  So I updated everything to bootstrap and styled a bit.  Also added one project.  (The one with the planets).</li>

          <li>4 Sept 2017 - I apologize for the barebone website, I'll try to make changes as time goes on.</li>
