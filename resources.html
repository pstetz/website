          <h3>Lectures</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E">Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course</a>.  Although somewhat dated, this lecture series is a classic.  If the lectures prove to be too difficult by themselves, consider supplementing the lectures with the <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/">course webpage</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4">Stanford's Computer Vision course (CS 231n)</a>.  Highly recommend this course to learn about Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, GANs, modern advances in computer vision.  Incredibly up-to-date material; check out the <a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/">course webpage</a> for more.

          <h3>Reading</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="http://colah.github.io/">Colah's blog</a>.  Incredibily insightful, well illustrated essays on Neural Networks from one of Google Brain's employees.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/index.html">Command Line for Data Science</a>.  Perhaps a niche skill among Data Scientist, impress your co-workers with your Terminal talent!  A very simple, efficient, automatable way to retrieve and scrub data.

          <p>
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>.  This website is huge and designed for all levels of data scientists.  If you are just starting out, check out <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview">Kaggle Learn</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="http://www.ds100.org/sp18/">Berkeley's Data Science 100</a>.  Excellent up-to-date course on some of the basics of Data Science.  I recommend trying the homework assignments <a href="https://github.com/DS-100/sp18">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">Hacker Rank</a>.  Challenges that span from basic to advanced on topics such as Statistics, Python, SQL, Java, and much more!
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>.  Similar to Hacker Rank, but I'd argue with a stronger emphasis on theory than language.  Great SQL exercises, check out the <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/">Database category</a>.

          <h3>Papers</h3>
          <p>
            Although academic papers may appear dense and intimidating to those unfamilar, they are the main source to the cutting-edge.  Here are some papers that I consider significant.

            <li>May 2015 - <strong>DRAW: A Recurrent Neural Network For Image Generation</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04623.pdf">link</a>). This paper introduces a RNN architecture that behaves similarily to the human eye when analyzing and classifying data</li>

            <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</strong>

            <li>Jun 2014 - <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf">link</a>).  Introduces a model capable of generating realistic data by using two networks: (1) a discrimitive network learning whether data is generated or real and (2) a generative network trying to produce data that maximizes the mistakes of the discrimitive model.  It might be interesting to look at Goodfellow's code supplementing the paper (<a href="https://github.com/goodfeli/adversarial">link</a>).</li>
