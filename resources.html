            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E">Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course</a>.  Although somewhat dated, this lecture series is a classic.  If the lectures prove to be too difficult by themselves, consider supplementing the lectures with the <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/">course webpage</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4">Stanford's Computer Vision course (CS 231n)</a>.

            <strong>Stay Determined!</strong>  Although academic papers may appear dense and intimidating at first, and stay that way.  However you get used to that aspect over time.  You got this!

          <p>
            <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong>.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>2012 - <strong>ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</strong> (<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf">link</a>).  This is the paper introducing AlexNet, a model that handely defeated 2nd place in the ILSVRC-2012 competition.</li>

            <li>Sept 2014 - <strong>Going Deeper with Convolutions</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf">link</a>).  Introducing the Inception architecture proposed by Google.  Implements multiple networks per layer and won ILSVRC14 with fewer parameters and less computation.</li>

            <li>Oct 2014 - <strong>Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2524.pdf">link</a>).  Details how to segment an image into region proposals, then classify by CNN networks.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)</strong>.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1997 - <strong>Long Short-Term Memory</strong> (<a href="http://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf">link</a>).  This paper introduces the architecture for LSTM that has since become the most successful model for RNNs</li>
            <li>Jun 2014 - <strong>Recurrent Models of Visual Attention</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.6247.pdf">link</a>).  This paper explores an RNN that performs better than CNNs on image detection.  The trick is selective focus; the network looks at clips of the image and then decides where to look next, much like a human eye.</li>
            <li>May 2015 - <strong>DRAW: A Recurrent Neural Network For Image Generation</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04623.pdf">link</a>). This paper expands off the previous paper by generating new images with this model.</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Jun 2014 - <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf">link</a>).  Introduces a model capable of generating realistic data by using two networks: (1) a discrimitive network learning whether data is generated or real and (2) a generative network trying to produce data that maximizes the mistakes of the discrimitive model.  It might be interesting to look at Goodfellow's code supplementing the paper (<a href="https://github.com/goodfeli/adversarial">link</a>).</li>
          </ul>

            <strong>Deep Learning (fun)</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mar 2012 - <strong>A Survey of Monte Carlo Tree Search Methods</strong> (<a href="http://mcts.ai/pubs/mcts-survey-master.pdf">link</a>).  Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) are one of the central factors leading to the success of DeepMind in Go.  Be wary the paper may be a bit outdated after 6 years.</li>

            <li>Oct 2017 - <strong>Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge</strong> (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270">link</a>).  Who would expect a model with less human intervention, a single neural network, and 1/12th the TPUs would beat the current champion AlphaGo Lee 100 to 0.</li>

            <li>Dec 2017 - <strong>Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815.pdf">link</a>).  The deep learning model of Go is extended to Chess/Shogi and defeats the previous computer world champions</li>
